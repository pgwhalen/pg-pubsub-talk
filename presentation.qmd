## Agenda
- PubSub in Theory
	- On Kafka
	- On Postgres, with LISTEN/NOTIFY
- LISTEN/NOTIFY in Practice
	- Config blob service
	- Shopping cart
	- Time series server
	- Ticker viewer
- Summary of patterns and gotchas

::: {.notes}
 - the goal of the presentation is unifying concepts and discussing the *detailed* tradeoffs
	- business use cases are somewhere in between
 - how messaging and persistence are closely related
	- data in motion vs data at rest is a fine line
 - use cases beyond just "generic job server"
 - less theory, more practice
	- not about the generic stuff, but about the application design stuff
 - lessons from our prod stuff (for each section, compare to kafka)
	- config daemon
		- you can't exceed the 8k limit
	- idea manager
		- you can be clever about indicating who should reload
		- can load a bunch of state, rather than just what was sent.
	- datashed
		- you can decouple the notifies from the reads, reading less frequently
		- do a lot of work (BUT DO IT ELSEWHERE)
	- consume
		- you can ensure you don't miss messages with sequence nums + time

# PubSub in Theory

## What is PubSub? {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- A messaging pattern
- Publishers send messages for a topic
- Subscribers receive messages on a topic
- Subscribers don't know about publishers, publishers don't know about subscribers
	- Something in the middle (a "broker") connects the two
- Optionally:
	- Usually real time
	- Persistent or ephemeral
	- "Queue" behavior, marking messages as processed
:::

## What is PubSub?

:::{.r-stretch fig-align="center"}
![](pubsub.excalidraw.svg)
:::

## Kafka as an implementation of PubSub {.smaller}
 - Producers publish messages on a topic to broker
 	- Messages are written in order, and assigned IDs ("offset")
 - Consumers subscribe to a topic and recieve messages from broker
	- Read from an offset

:::{.r-stretch}
![](kafka.excalidraw.svg)
:::

## Kafka key points

::: {.incremental}
 - Messages are persisted
 - Consumer can read older messages
 - Consumers process every message
 - Consumers read the entire message
:::

## Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY

 - `NOTIFY` is the "publish" command (writer)
 - `LISTEN` is the "subscribe" command (reader)
 - `NOTIFY` sends a message on a channel
 - Any connection currently `LISTEN`ing on that channel receives the message

:::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="65%"}
Publisher:
```{.sql background-color="green"}
SELECT pg_notify('a_channel', 'hello world');
```
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
Subscriber:
```{.sql .pubsql}
LISTEN a_channel;
```
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
 - calling the function
:::

## "Kafka" on Postgres
 - A table per topic
 - Publisher writes to table, `NOTIFY` ID
 - Susbcriber `LISTEN`S, reads messages from table

::: {.notes}
 - this is the simplest possible implementation
:::

## "Kafka" on Postgres

Table to store messages
```{python}
run_sql("""
CREATE TABLE a_topic (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	message TEXT
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

Subscriber listens
```{.sql .myframe}
LISTEN a_topic;
```

Publisher writes message...
```{python}
run_sql("""
INSERT INTO a_topic (message)
VALUES ('hi')
RETURNING id
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
... and notifies that it has been written (transactionally)
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify('a_topic', '1')
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

## "Kafka" on Postgres

Subscriber receives notification...
```{.log}
'1'
```
... and reads message
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT * FROM a_topic WHERE id = 1
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```


::: {.notes}
 - notice we're not sending the whole message: it's a bad idea, more on that later
:::

# LISTEN/NOTIFY in Production

# Config Blob Service

## Config Blob Service

 - A service that provides create/read/update/delete storage for a blob
 - Updates are pushed out immediately to the front end
 - The configuration is opaque to the DB, understood only by the
 application

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
CREATE TABLE profile_config
(
    profile_id  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    modified_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    config      JSON
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

## Writing Data

Example config blob
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT json_build_object(
    'profile_id', 1,
	'config_key', 'config_val'
) AS data
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```

## Writing Data

Insert blob
```{python}
run_sql("""
INSERT INTO profile_config (modified_at, config)
VALUES (
	now(),
	json_build_object(
    	'profile_id', 1,
		'config_key', 'config_val'
	)
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

Notify `config_update` channel with contents of blob
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify(
	'config_update',
	json_build_object(
		'profile_id', 1,
		'config_key', 'config_val'
	)::text
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

## Reading Data

Subscriber `LISTEN`s (before data was written)
```{.sql}
LISTEN config_update;
```

Receives
```{.log}
{‘profile_id’: 1, ‘config_key’: ‘config_val’}
```

::: {.fragment}
... **there's no `SELECT`!**
:::

::: {.fragment}
Cool!

 - Faster
 - Less indirection
 - Like Kafka: only receive, not the notify *then* read
:::

## Large write

But what if the newly written config blob is big?

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
#| error: true
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify(
	'config_update',
	json_build_object(
		'profile_id', 1,
		'config_key', REPEAT('a', 10000)
	)::text
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

## Large write problems

 - **❗ Gotcha ❗**: `NOTIFY` payloads have a **hard 8kb limit**
 - You must know the data you're putting in the payload
	- Don't accept untrusted data
	- In our case, it wasn't malicious, and it was only just barely over

:::{.notes}
 - the only way to get around the limit is to recompile postgres!
 - growth
:::

## Large writes

::: {.incremental}
 - Kafka has a message limit size too, but it is much larger (1MB)
	- (with config, you can get it up over 100MB)
 - I have also been the idiot writing large messages in Kafka
 - In Postgres, you can decouple the notification from the read/write
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: `NOTIFY` *instructions* about what to read, not the data itself
	- Many times, this is the ID of a row
:::

# Shopping Cart

::: {.notes}
 - not something we've built, but easier without explaining trading
:::

## Shopping

 - A service that manages an online shopping cart (e.g. Amazon)
 - When an item is added to the cart, a row is added to the table
 - A front end is connecting to one instance of the server and is `LISTEN`ing to postgres
 	- There are multiple instances of the service

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
CREATE TABLE shopping_cart
(
    id       SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    item     TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT NOT NULL
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

## Adding an item to the cart

::: {.fragment}
Add item
```{python}
run_sql("""
INSERT INTO shopping_cart (item, username)
VALUES ('iPhone', 'paul')
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
Rather than `NOTIFY`ing the ID, we `NOTIFY` for the *user*:
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify('shopping_cart', 'paul')
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

**🟢 Pattern 🟢**: `NOTIFY` *instructions* about what to read, not the data itself
:::

::: {.fragment}
Listening
```{.sql}
LISTEN a_channel;  -- 'paul'
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
Read the *entire* cart for the user
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT *
FROM shopping_cart
WHERE username = 'paul'
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```
:::

## Querying for the whole cart

::: {.incremental}
 - Querying for the entire shopping cart is easiest
	- Service doesn't need to track to cart, it just refreshes it
	- The whole cart is never prohibitively large
 - With Kafka, you get all the messages
	- Must track the state of the cart in the service
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: On `LISTEN`, query for the whole state
	- Let the database manage the state
 - Stateful stream processing with Kafka:
	- The greatest mistake of my career
:::

## Not querying at all

::: {.incremental}
 - A given user front end is only connected to one instance
 - We only need to read the cart if the user is connected to that instance
 - With Kafka, you have to receive the contents of all messages
	- Exception: *partitions*
	- Partitions can be clumsly; you can only partition one way
:::

## Bonus: Handling deletes {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
Add a column representing items that were removed from the cart
```{python}
run_sql("""
ALTER TABLE shopping_cart
    ADD COLUMN removed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
User removes from cart
```{python}
run_sql("""
UPDATE shopping_cart
SET removed = true
WHERE ID = 1
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify('shopping_cart', 'paul')
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT *
FROM shopping_cart
WHERE username = 'paul'
AND NOT removed
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

... there's nothing in the cart!
:::

::: {.fragment}
**🟢 Pattern 🟢**: Query for the whole state, let the database manage the state
:::

## Deletes in Kafka

- "Tombstone" messages indicating delete
- Application must update state to handle delete
	- Often surprisingly hard, especially when it involves
	outputting more tombstone messages

# Time Series Server

## Time Series Server

 - Time series storage of stock prices throughout the day
 - Traders want to see up-to-date aggregations, like min/max/avg

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
CREATE TABLE stock_price
(
    ticker    TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    price     NUMERIC
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

## A write-heavy workload

Stock price changes *a lot*

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
INSERT INTO stock_price (ticker, timestamp, price)
VALUES ('AAPL', '2025-01-01 8:30:00', 100.00),
       ('AAPL', '2025-01-01 8:30:01', 100.01),
       ('AAPL', '2025-01-01 8:30:02', 100.02)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify('stock_price', 'AAPL');
SELECT pg_notify('stock_price', 'AAPL');
SELECT pg_notify('stock_price', 'AAPL')
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

```{.sql}
LISTEN stock_price;
```
```{.log}
'AAPL'
'AAPL'
'AAPL'
```
:::

## Serving up-to-date aggregations {.smaller}

On `LISTEN`, we do this aggregation query 3 times

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT ticker, avg(price) FROM stock_price
GROUP BY ticker
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```
:::

::: {.incremental}
 - This query could be intensive with a lot of data
 - Queries could get backed up behind each other on thread the service is using to `LISTEN`
 - **❗ Gotcha ❗**: The `LISTEN` thread can get backed up
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: Do your work elsewhere from the `LISTEN` thread
 - If stock prices are changing faster than the user can see anyway, do you need to keep up?
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: `LISTEN`er doesn't need to care about every message
:::

# Ticker View

## Ticker View

 - Traders are constantly switching between stock tickers to view data related to a given ticker
 - When a trader switches what ticker they're viewing, each UI receives a message from the service with the ticker to load data for

## Ticker View Architecture

:::{.r-stretch}
![](tickerview.excalidraw.svg)
:::

## Ticker View Schema

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
CREATE TABLE ticker_view
(
    id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username  TEXT NOT NULL,
    ticker    TEXT NOT NULL
)
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
:::

## Basic Ticker View Pub Sub

We've seen all this before...
```{python}
run_sql("""
INSERT INTO ticker_view (username, ticker)
VALUES ('paul', 'AAPL')
RETURNING id
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT pg_notify('ticker_view', '1')
""", print_sql=True, print_output=False)
```

```{.sql}
LISTEN ticker_view;
```
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT ticker FROM ticker_view
WHERE id = 1
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```

## Goal: High Availabilitiy

::: {.incremental}
 - What if the UI briefly loses connection to the service?
 - What if the service briefly loses connection to the database?
 - **❗ Gotcha ❗**: You miss messages when you aren't connected
:::

## Querying for what we missed

::: {.incremental}
 - How do we know what we missed?
 - Let's assume the UI was keeping track of the ID of the last
 message it received
	- In this case, `0` to indicate it hasn't received any messages
:::

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT ticker FROM ticker_view
WHERE id > 0
AND username = 'paul'
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```
:::

## Multiple missed messages, like Kafka {.smaller}

```{python}
run_sql("""
INSERT INTO ticker_view (username, ticker)
VALUES ('paul', 'NVDA')
""", print_sql=False, print_output=False)
```

But what if we missed multiple messages?
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT id, ticker FROM ticker_view
WHERE id > 0
AND username = 'paul'
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```

::: {.incremental}
 - This is analogous to a concept in Kafka called **consumer groups**
 - Consumer Groups help you pick up where you left off, by keeping track of the last message ID ("offset")
 - With Kafka you have to consume every message, which we don't want to do in this case
:::

## Multiple missed messages, with Postgres {.smaller}

For this use case, we only care about the last message of the ones that we missed
```{python}
run_sql("""
SELECT id, ticker FROM ticker_view
WHERE username = 'paul'
AND id > 0
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
""", print_sql=True, print_output=True)
```

::: {.fragment}
 - This is more useful to us than Kafka Consumer Groups!
 - Not having to read every message is an *advantage*
 - It all depends on the use case 
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: `LISTEN`er doesn't need to care about every message
:::

# Patterns and Gotchas Summary

## Patterns and Gotchas

 - **❗ Gotcha ❗**: `NOTIFY` payloads have a **hard 8kb limit**
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: `NOTIFY` *instructions* about what to read, not the data itself
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: `LISTEN`er doesn't need to care about every message
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: On `LISTEN`, query for the whole state, let the database manage the state
 - **❗ Gotcha ❗**: The `LISTEN` thread can get backed up
 - **🟢 Pattern 🟢**: Do your work elsewhere from the `LISTEN` thread


## Some notes on *scale*, Kafka, and Postgres

 - Kafka is good for lots of messages and lots of subscribers
 - Do you really need to send that many messages?
 - Do you really need that many subscribers?
 - You can get far on Postgres using the right patterns

## Thanks For Listening!
